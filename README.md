# MBaC
MultiBase Computer

Johann is a pathetic little sod who lives in a cave of programs and guitars. He knows nothing of humans, but at least he's got some ambition.

The MultiBase Computer is an emulation of a ternary computer to explore the advantages and disavdantages of it in comparison to a sister emulation using binary, also included. The library is designed to be able to allow for other bases to be used, though these will not be included in this repository. If the reader wishes, they can clone this repository and make additions to the code, though this repository falls under the MIT Open License.
